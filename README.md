This repository provides a comprehensive collection of biomarker databases, serving as an invaluable reference for biomedical professionals and researchers. It showcases both general and specialized databases. Updates will be made monthly to keep the content current.

Despite the growing importance of molecular biomarkers in personalized medicine, there is a surprising need for comprehensive, free-to-access databases. The few available, such as GOBIOM, Biomarkerbase, and the Human Gene Mutation Database, mainly operate commercially and are not freely accessible to all researchers. Moreover, the information in these databases is often presented in lists or detailed descriptions, making it challenging to extract and understand without investing much time. Their visualization tools are also limited, mainly offering just basic summaries.
